ePadlite Installation Guide
For more information please visit https://github.com/RubinLab/epad-dist

IMPORTANT:
1) For some locations you will see X in the text. The letter X means a variable. 
This variable will be different when you install a new version of ePad
Example : epad-dist-0.X.zip the X will be 2, 3, 4 ... depending on the version of ePad.

2) Starting from version v0.4 coucdb image updated to ibmcom/couchdb3:latest this causes folder right/ownership issues with the older default image
which was apache/couchdb:latest. If you are installing ePad and you have the old data from apache/cocuhdb for now point a different couchdb data location
during the installation. We are working on a fix to solve the folder rights/ownership issues

3) For linux users: 
After the installation you will need to give public folder rights (777) for the folders listed below. After changing the folder rights you will need to restart ePad.
	-pluginData
	-Couchdb data folder. By default it is couchdbloc
	-tmp
All the folder listed above will be in your installation folder. (Not in epad-dist and not in epad_lite_dist) In the same folder where you see epad-dist folder listed.

4) If you want to use plugin functionality:
	Mac users :
		- You will need to give public rights to your docker.sock
			to do : sudo chmod -h 777 /var/run/docker.sock
	Linux users:
		-You will need to edit docker-compose.yml file in your epad_lite_dist folder. You will need to give correct docker group id to ARG_EPAD_DOCKER_GID variable. 
			to do :  
			1) locate and edit your docker-compose.yml
			2) under myepadlite section locate " args: " section 
			3) ARG_EPAD_DOCKER_GID: 999 -> replace 999 with the correct docker group id collected from your server.
				- to see docker group id use the command ->  cat /etc/group | grep docker 
				- for example in my machine the command above gives : 
					docker:x:981:cavit,epad
				- In this case docker group id for me will be 981. The names that we see after 981 are the users belongs to docker group. 

			4) if you started ePad earlier stop epad_lite container (docker stop epad_lite)
			5) remove epad_lite container (docker rm epad_lite)
			6) remove your epad_lite image 
				- docker images (will list all your images)
				- collect image id for epadlitedist_myepadlite 
				- docker rmi imageid (delete the image)
			7) Restart ePad to activate plugins
				- Switch to epad_lite_dist
				- docker-compose up -d (this will recreate a new image with plugins activated. It will create a new epad_lite container and it will start it)

- epadlite Installation 

	commands : these commands are for linux and Mac

	1) Once you download ePadlite you will have epad-dist-0.X.zip
 	2)create a directory where you will extract the zip file 
 		(for my case i am creating epadtest directory and the path in my case is /Users/cavit/)
		(command below :)
		 mkdir epadtest


	3) Switch to the directory that you just created 
		(command below: )
		cd epadtest
		(after the command in my case i am in /Users/cavit/epadtest/)

	4)copy the zip file into the directory where you will extract the zip file 
		in my case from downloads to epadtest
		(command below: )
		cp  /Users/cavit/Downloads/epad-dist-0.X.zip  /Users/cavit/epadtest/epad-dist-0.X.zip

	5)Switch to the folder where you copied epad-dist-0.X.zip and extract it
		(for the example case)
		(commands below:)
		cd /Users/cavit/epadtest/
		unzip epad-dist-0.X.zip

	6)After  unzipping you will have regular epad-dist-0.X folder. Switch to this folder
		(command below:)
		cd epad-dist-0.X
		(after the command in my case i am in /Users/cavit/epadtest/epad-dist-0.X)

	7)In the folder edit epad.yml file and save
		The sections that you need to edit start with YOUR_ 
		put hostname , usernames , passwords and emails. Host name can be an IP address or host name . Make sure that you collect the correct host name.
		Sometimes host names are not mapped to the ips. In such case you will need to use ip instead of the host name .PLEASE DON'T USE localhost for the host
		(for example in my computer I edited the sections below. Don’t delete the parts that you don’t see below from the epad.yml file)
		host: c02s30xdg8wl.local/
		keycloak:
		   	user: admin
		   	password: admin
  		   	email: admin@gmail.com
		
		couchdb:
			user: admin
			password: admin

		mariadb:
  			user: admin
  			password: admin
  			rootpassword: admin

	   8) In the same directory (we should be in the directory epad-dist-0.X where you see epad.yml and configure_epad.sh files) run the command below.
			(in my case I am in this path /Users/cavit/epadtest/epad-dist-0.X)
			(command below will create epad_lite_dist folder outside of epad-dist-0.X)
			./configure_epad.sh ../epad_lite_dist ./epad.yml
			
	  9) Switch to one upper level folder 
			(command below:) 
			cd ..
			(in my case after running the command above I am in /Users/cavit/epadtest )

	10) Switch to the folder epad_lite_dist
			(command below:)
			cd epad_lite_dist
			(after the command i am in /Users/cavit/epadtest/epad_lite_dist)	

	11) Make sure that you see the docker-compose.yml file and start epad
			(command below:)
			docker-compose up -d
			(after this command you will see 6 containers epad_js,epad_lite,epad_dicomweb,epad_keycloak,epad_couchdb,epad_mariadb.    
			when all the containers are running (this means status Up. To check the status use the command: docker ps -a) you can browse ePad. In my case I browse c02s30xdg8wl.local/)
			Note: Only these 4 containers epad_lite, epad_dicomweb, epad_couchdb, epad_mariadb, status will be healty. 

	12) To stop epad and to remove containers (you need to see docker-compose.yml file) IMPORTANT : If you use the comand below, it will delete your containers. Deleting epad_keycloak container will result deleting 
		your keycloak users. If you would like to backup your keycloak users please use ePad installation script (epad_manage.sh see documantation at epad.stanford.edu)
			docker-compose down

		in the case that you want to keep keycloak users and want to stop ePad use the command below
			docker stop epad_js epad_lite epad_dicomweb epad_keycloak epad_couchdb epad_mariadb

Some useful docker commands
	*) list all containers (it will list names also and the status of the containers . Running,healty ,exited etc. )
		docker ps -a
	
	*) to start only one specific container
		docker start containername
	
	*)to stop only one specific container
		docker stop containername
			
	*) See log file for a container
		docker logs container name

	*) see the log file in tun time 
		docker logs -f  containername
